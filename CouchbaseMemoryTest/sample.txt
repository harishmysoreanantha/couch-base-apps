            Running The Apache Tomcat 7.0 Servlet/JSP Container
            ===================================================

Apache Tomcat 7.0 requires a Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 6 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 6 Or Later
=============================



When running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files
and directories are split as following:

In CATALINA_BASE:

 * bin  - Only the following files:

           * setenv.sh (*nix) or setenv.bat (Windows),
           * tomcat-juli.jar

          The setenv scripts were described above. The tomcat-juli library
          is documented in the Logging chapter in the User Guide.

 * conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * logs - Log and output files

 * webapps - Automatically loaded web applications

 * work - Temporary working directories for web applications

 * temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files (java.io.tmpdir)


In CATALINA_HOME:

 * bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts

          The following files will be used only if they are absent in
          CATALINA_BASE/bin:

          setenv.sh (*nix), setenv.bat (Windows), tomcat-juli.jar

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * endorsed - Libraries that override standard "Endorsed Standards"
              libraries provided by JRE. See Classloading documentation
              in the User Guide for details.

              By default this "endorsed" directory is absent.

In the default configuration the JAR libraries and classes both in
CATALINA_BASE/lib and in CATALINA_HOME/lib will be added to the common
classpath, but the ones in CATALINA_BASE will be added first and thus will
be searched first.

The idea is that you may leave the standard Tomcat libraries in
CATALINA_HOME/lib and add other ones such as database drivers into
CATALINA_BASE/lib.

In general it is advised to never share libraries between web applications,
but put them into WEB-INF/lib directories inside the applications. See
Classloading documentation in the User Guide for details.


It might be useful to note that the values of CATALINA_HOME and
CATALINA_BASE can be referenced in the XML configuration files processed
by Tomcat as ${catalina.home} and ${catalina.base} respectively.

For example, the standard manager web application can be kept in
CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager and loaded into CATALINA_BASE by using
the following trick:

 * Copy the CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
   file as CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost/manager.xml

 * Add docBase attribute as shown below.

The file will look like the following:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Context docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager"
    antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.0\.0\.1" />
  </Context>

See Deployer chapter in User Guide and Context and Host chapters in the
Configuration Reference for more information on contexts and web
application deployment.

Troubleshooting
================

There are only really 2 things likely to go wrong during the stand-alone
Tomcat install:

(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that
    Tomcat attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

       $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml

    and search for '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
    greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
    access to bind under UNIX.

    Restart Tomcat and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "8080"
    in the URL you're using to access Tomcat.  For example, if you change the
    port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/ in your
    browser.

(2) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a
    proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your
    browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the
    "localhost".
